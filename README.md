# Metadata for Machine Learning (m4ml)
![maintenance-status](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintenance-deprecated-red.svg)

A data repository to store ML-related metadata crosswalks and a metadata schema based on schema.org

**Not maintained 2024.06.27**
- This repository is not currently in use. 
- Crosswalks have been moved to https://github.com/RDA-FAIR4ML/FAIR4ML-crosswalks
- The metadata schema is now a joint effort part of the RDA FAIR4ML IG and is available at https://github.com/RDA-FAIR4ML/FAIR4ML-schema

## Communities
Some communities have expressed interest in a community-agreed metadata schema describing Machine Learning models, for instance the [Research Data Alliance (RDA) FAIR4ML Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-machine-learning-fair4ml-ig), [ELIXIR Machine Learning Focus Group (ELIXIR MLFG](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups/machine-learning) and the [National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (NFDI4DataScience, NFDI4DS)](https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/), one of the [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en) consortia in Germany.

A task force was created in the RDA FAIR4ML IG, Task Force 2 working towards a common metadata schema based on schema.org. This task force also counts with members from ELIXIR MLFG and NFDI4DS who keep the liasion to their respective communities.

## Activities
In additoin to regular meetings hosted individually by the three communities, there have been some joint activities to boost the creation of such a schema.
* NFDI4DS Machine Learning Lifecycle hackathon from the 21st to the 22nd of November 2023 at [ZB MED](https://www.zbmed.de/en/) --although more related to the TAsk Force 1 on FAIR for ML in the RDA FARI4ML IG, this activity also provided insights for the creation of the schema
* NFDI4DS Machine Learning Metadata hackathon from the 23rd to the 24th of November 2023 at [ZB MED](https://www.zbmed.de/en/)

## Contributions
The three communities acnd corresonding members have somehow contributed to this work. Here we mention individuals that have directly contributed so far to literature review, crosswalks or schema drafts. In alphabetical order:
